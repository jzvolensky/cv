# Article 1: Welcome to the blog

This is my first ever blog post. I am not really sure what I am doing here, but I am excited to start this journey. I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them. There will be a variety of posts.

## How this website was built

I guess a good starting point is to explain some basics about how this website was built. I started with a template from `HTML5up`. I wanted to keep the site simple and clean. I have considered using something like `Nextjs` but to be fair, I do not care enough about web development to spend time learning a new framework.The current setup involves basic `HTML` and `CSS` and a few static `JavaScript` libraries for things like parsing these markdowns into blog posts. The whole thing is hosted on GitHub Pages because it is free and easy to set up.

## What to expect

I will probably write about a lot of things. Other than tech I am also interested in rockets, space exploration, engineering, and a lot of other things. I have decided to incorporate a tagging system to help you navigate through the posts. I hope you find it useful.

## Future plans

I think that is all for now. I spent today building this website so I do not have much else to say. In the next posts, I will try to **introduce some of the work** I am doing and why I think it is interesting.

Since in the introduction I mentioned that I like travelling here is a picture from one of my recent travels in Northern Italy:
